#Air Pod

I developed this game around 2013. It uses Objective-C and utilizes the the Sparrow framework.

The design and inspiration for the game was from an Game Maker/Flash game by Alexitron; I adapted it for mobile and added new features.

It reads map files in a simple CSV format that can be exported by the Tiled application. Maps are read in Map.m.

This is only the sourcecode portion, and will need to be established in a proper Xcode project with the Sparrow framework and artwork/assets included.
